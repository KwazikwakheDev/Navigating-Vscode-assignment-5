   - Alternatively, navigate to the View menu and select "Terminal."

   - Type commands directly into the terminal.
   - Run scripts, compile code, or execute any terminal-based tasks.
   - Use standard keyboard shortcuts and commands.

   - Integrated terminal stays within VS Code interface, no need to switch between windows.
   - Boost Productivity by faster access speeds up workflow, eliminating the need to open an external terminal separately.

   + Set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers.
   + Press F5 or click on the green play button to start debugging.

   - Key Debugging Features 
   + Set breakpoints to pause code execution at specific lines for inspection.
   + View the values of variables at any point during debugging.
   + Monitor specific variables or expressions and see their values change in real-time.
   + Visualize the call stack to understand the hierarchy of function calls
   + Step into, over, or out of function calls to navigate through code execution.


10. **Using Source Control:**
How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
